Description: 
    Provides an S4 class 'sparse_numeric' for representing numeric vectors 
    in sparse form, storing only non-zero entries and their positions. 
    The package includes constructor and coercion methods, arithmetic 
    operations, crossproduct, summary methods (mean, norm), and 
    standardization, all implemented efficiently without converting 
    to dense representation. Plotting methods for sparse objects and 
    full documentation are included.
